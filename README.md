# <Mega Awesome Page!>

## Description

The purpose of this project to my understanding, was to practice refactoring the code, organizing the code using semantic CSS, and improving the code by making it neater, and consolidatng repeated CSS Selectors into singular classes that achieve the same result, without said repetitive selectors.

The code has been refactored, with classes being renamed, slightly reorganized, and repeated code being consolidated to make it easier to read and to identify elements on the page. 

Overall, im pleased with the final product. I'm sure there are ways to further optimize the code, and I'm excited to learn more CSS!
